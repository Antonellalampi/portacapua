The Porta di Capua, or Gate of the two towers, was a monumental fortified architecture commissioned by Frederick II of Swabia, in the place of the bridge over the Volturno, in the fortified city of Capua which was the main gateway to the Neapolitan province of earth work for those who came from the north.

The construction was ordered in 1234 to direct dominion of Federico II: the work, entrusted with very broad powers to the architect Nicholas of Cicala (fl. 1218- September 1247), was completed in 1239-1240.

He wanted to inspire the monumentality expressed by the Triumphal Arches of the imperial era, in particular those which the sovereign had direct and recent experience: the Arch of Augustus in Rimini, and the Arch of Constantine and the Coliseum.
